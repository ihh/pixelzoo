Capture the flag

If, during your turn, you are able to destroy all particles of type X,
then you gain ownership of the board.

Constraints:
 Turns have fixed time limits.
 After their turn, a player is locked out for a random time.
 Guest-writable-cells  \subset  Owner-writable-cells  \subseteq  Board

Richard's advice: implement this game exactly as described.

Extensions:
Users can upload their own particle and tool XML.
New particles/tools are priced by the system.
Tool designers get in-game credit when players buy their tools.
