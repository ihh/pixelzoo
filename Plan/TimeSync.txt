Refactoring from continuous-time to discrete-time to allow "time sync" (100% accurate board replay given initial state + moves)

New types:

int64_Ticks
int64_Microticks
int64_Hurtz
int64_Microhurtz

int64_Millionths


Tasks:

BinTree, QuadTree: Convert double --> int64_Microhurtz
randomDouble: Convert double --> int64_Millionth
randomExp: Convert double --> int64_Microticks, rename to randomWait (1 Hurtz)
Board, Game: Convert double --> int64_Microticks (board time), int64_Ticks (input evolve-time arg), int64_Hurtz (input board-rate arg)

Remove all "overload"-related game logic (rules, tests).
Add an input queue to Board.
Implement an integer-based random number generator.
