Refactoring from continuous-time to discrete-time to allow "time sync" (100% accurate board replay given initial state + moves)

New types:

uint64_Secs
uint64_Nanosecs
uint64_Hertz
uint64_Nanohertz

uint64_Billionths


Tasks:

BinTree, QuadTree: Convert double --> uint64_Nanohertz
randomDouble: Convert double --> uint64_Billionth
randomExp: Convert double --> uint64_Nanosecs, rename to randomWait (1 Hertz)
Board, Game: Convert double --> uint64_Nanosecs (board time), uint64_Secs (input evolve-time arg), uint64_Hertz (input board-rate arg)

Remove all "overload"-related game logic (rules, tests).
Add an input queue to Board.
Implement an integer-based random number generator.
