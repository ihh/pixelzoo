<h1>PixelZoo</h1>

<p>A client-server architecture for 2D cellular automata simulations.
(See doc/index.html file for developer documentation.)</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>PixelZoo is a project-in-progress to build multiplayer
turn-based games using fast two-dimensional stochastic Cellular
Automata (CA).</p>

<p>The graphics aesthetic is experimental and minimal. Particles in the
game are just colored pixels. There is some textual feedback: particle
names, "speech balloons", an output console. The design goal is that
particles are characterized by the player largely according to their
behavior as microscopic agents.</p>

<p>The CA's state machines are programmed using a minimal rule language
with only a few elements: integer variables, addition, a C-like
"switch", UNIX-like signals ("messages"). This makes it very easy to
analyze the programs (i.e. predict their CPU usage), while being rich
enough to implement models from physics, chemistry and biology, e.g.</p>

<ul>
<li>simple models of ideal gases</li>
<li>Brownian motion and Brownian superprocesses</li>
<li>diffusion-limited-aggregation and crystal growth</li>
<li>chemical kinetics, the Belousovâ€“Zhabotinsky reaction</li>
<li>the two-dimensional Ising model of magnetic spin arrays</li>
<li>mesoscale dynamics of polymers and entangled polymer melts</li>
<li>the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model of epidemiology</li>
<li>neutral drift models in population genetics and ecology</li>
<li>forest fires, ants, bacteria, traffic, crowds, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the single-player (tutorial) version of the game, the player
attempts to solve various puzzles and challenges (e.g. "maintain an
ecology of >N different species for time >T, in the face of various
natural disasters").</p>

<p>In the multi-player version, which is turn-based, players compete for
control of self-contained playing boards ("worlds"). Players can also
create their own (self-replicating) CA programs, and trade these
in-game.</p>

<h1>State of the project</h1>

<p>We said it was a work-in-progress, didn't we?</p>

<p>Mostly completed parts include:</p>

<ul>
<li>an XML schema for describing state-machine rules and level goals</li>
<li>a core ANSI C library that runs games and verifies moves</li>
<li>Perl modules for generating and compiling levels</li>
<li>tests and (some) documentation</li>
</ul>

<p>Work in progress includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>a RESTful multiplayer game server, based on Perl Catalyst</li>
<li>clients for iOS, Android and Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Dependencies</h1>

<p>Depending on what you want to build, you will need some other stuff
installed.</p>

<h2>Core client engine</h2>

<p>C code in src/, compiles into lib/</p>

<h2>SDL client</h2>

<p>C code in tsrc/sdltest.c</p>

<p>Requires Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL).</p>

<ul>
<li>http://www.libsdl.org/</li>
</ul>

<h2>iOS client</h2>

<p>Objective-C code and Xcode IDE files in xcode/pixelzoo/</p>

<p>Requires Xcode IDE and iOS development framework.</p>

<ul>
<li>http://developer.apple.com/xcode/</li>
</ul>

<h2>Android client</h2>

<p>Java/C code and Eclipse IDE files in android/</p>

<p>Requires Eclipse IDE and Android SDK/NDK.</p>

<ul>
<li>http://www.eclipse.org/</li>
<li>http://developer.android.com/sdk/</li>
<li>http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/</li>
</ul>

<h2>Server</h2>

<p>Perl code in perl/ and Zoo/</p>

<p>The game XML compiler, perl/zoocompiler.pl, requires various modules from CPAN,
notably XML::Twig and Moose.</p>

<ul>
<li>http://www.cpan.org/</li>
</ul>

<p>The server framework in Zoo/ requires Perl Catalyst, and a few other modules.
Do 'cd Zoo; perl Makefile.PL; make' to install other dependencies from CPAN.</p>
