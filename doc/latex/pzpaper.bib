doi = {10.1534/genetics.112.147611}, 
abstract ={Inferring the nature and magnitude of selection is an important problem in many biological contexts. Typically when estimating a selection coefficient for an allele, it is assumed that samples are drawn from a panmictic population and that selection acts uniformly across the population. However, these assumptions are rarely satisfied. Natural populations are almost always structured, and selective pressures are likely to act differentially. Inference about selection ought therefore to take account of structure. We do this by considering evolution in a simple lattice model of spatial population structure. We develop a hidden Markov model based maximum-likelihood approach for estimating the selection coefficient in a single population from time series data of allele frequencies. We then develop an approximate extension of this to the structured case to provide a joint estimate of migration rate and spatially varying selection coefficients. We illustrate our method using classical data sets of moth pigmentation morph frequencies, but it has wide applications in settings ranging from ecology to human evolution.},

@phdthesis{rest,
  abstract = {The World Wide Web has succeeded in large part because its software
	architecture has been designed to meet the needs of an Internet-scale
	distributed hypermedia system. The Web has been iteratively developed
	over the past ten years through a series of modifications to the
	standards that define its architecture. In order to identify those
	aspects of the Web that needed improvement and avoid undesirable
	modifications, a model for the modern Web architecture was needed
	to guide its design, definition, and deployment.
	
	Software architecture research investigates methods for determining
	how best to partition a system, how components identify and communicate
	with each other, how information is communicated, how elements of
	a system can evolve independently, and how all of the above can be
	described using formal and informal notations. My work is motivated
	by the desire to understand and evaluate the architectural design
	of network-based application software through principled use of architectural
	constraints, thereby obtaining the functional, performance, and social
	properties desired of an architecture. An architectural style is
	a named, coordinated set of architectural constraints.
	
	This dissertation defines a framework for understanding software architecture
	via architectural styles and demonstrates how styles can be used
	to guide the architectural design of network-based application software.
	A survey of architectural styles for network-based applications is
	used to classify styles according to the architectural properties
	they induce on an architecture for distributed hypermedia. I then
	introduce the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural
	style and describe how REST has been used to guide the design and
	development of the architecture for the modern Web.
	
	REST emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality
	of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary
	components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate
	legacy systems. I describe the software engineering principles guiding
	REST and the interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles,
	contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles.
	Finally, I describe the lessons learned from applying REST to the
	design of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifier
	standards, and from their subsequent deployment in Web client and
	server software.},

    abstract = {<title>Author Summary</title><p>Many species of planktonic bacteria are able to propel themselves through a liquid medium by the use of one or more helical flagella. Commonly, the observed motile behaviour consists of a series of approximately straight-line movements, interspersed with random, approximately stationary, reorientation events. This phenomenon is of current interest as it is known to be linked to important bacterial processes such as pathogenicity and biofilm formation. An accepted experimental approach for studying bacterial motility in approximately indigenous conditions is the tracking of cells using a microscope. However, there are currently no validated methods for the analysis of such tracking data. In particular, the identification of reorientation phases, which is complicated by various sources of noise in the data, remains an open challenge. In this paper we present novel methods for analysing large bacterial tracking datasets. We assess the performance of our new methods using computational simulations, and show that they are more reliable than a previously published method. We proceed to analyse previously unpublished tracks from the bacterial species <italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</italic>, an emerging model organism in the field of bacterial motility, and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, a well-studied model bacterium. The analysis demonstrates the novel result that <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> exhibits directional persistence over the course of a reorientation event.</p>},
