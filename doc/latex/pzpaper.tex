\section{Introduction}

Goal: 
build simulation game for mobile devices,

and several models from stochastic biophysics
including simulations of polymer and RNA folding kinetics.

\section{Simulation}

Architecture of Cellular Automata platform.

\subsection{Low-Level Instruction Set}

Low-level (machine code):
state machines.

Synchronized and asynchronous callback.
Asynchronous guarantees callback with an exponentially-distributed wait time, scaled by particle's update rate.
Random number generator is Mersenne twister, built into board, and is replayable.

Addressing: local neighborhood.
Memory structure: 64 bits of state per cell, plus a pointer to opaque storage (can only be accessed via the supervisor scripting language).

Main 64-bit state divided into bitfields. 16 bits given over to a type field, determining how cell will be updated.
Remaining 48 bits used as dynamic storage; division into bitfields depends on the type, with some universal restrictions (e.g. bitfields cannot straddle a 32-bit boundary).
Supplemented by larger amount of read-only global storage (including global program).

The 16-bit type field selects the global program to update the cell and its neighborhood,
and also specifies a naming and sizing scheme for bitfields associated with that type's use of the dynamic storage in that cell.

The global program for a state machine is a minimal CISC architecture generalizes the concept of the state lookup table, to facilitate partial matching of neighborhoods and bitfields.
The instruction set for the global program is a recognizable subset of (or easily implemented on) well-known RISC architectures, e.g. ARM\cite{seal00} and virtual game architectures, like Core War's RedCode\cite{CoreWarGuidelines84}.
The instruction set can also be quickly interpreted or implemented in C, and optimized well by C compilers.
Such details of the implementation are left opaque by design.
Code written for the low-level state machine cannot reflect on or modify its own global program.

Instruction set.
Load and Store allow access to (named) bitfields.
Load-Compare-Branch.
Load-Add-Store (this operation also move or destroy the opaque storage).
Random-Branch (random number generator replayable).
Load-Switch (can be implemented as a tree of Load-Compare-Branch, or internally as a jump table).
Goto.
Execute Scheme function (access restricted).

Control flow: goto, no loops, no gosub. Program is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of finite maximum length.
Facilitates analysis and prediction of resource usage---requirements for player-uploaded programs.

\subsubsection{Addressing Modes}

Several addressing modes.

Immediate vs register addressing.

Indirect addressing (registers specify cell offset, bitfield sub-address).

In principle do not need indirect or register addressing: can explicitly enumerate all cases via immediate addressing.
In practice, useful to allow some indirect and register addressing, to reduce program sizes via re-use of subroutine code.

Goto label in neighbor's program: effectively a primitive message delivery mechanism,
but must be restricted as it can create loops.

\subsubsection{Assembly Language}

Low-level (assembly language):
Scheme. Generates (assembles) instructions for state machine.
Large built-in library for replicating patterns over Moore or von Neumann neighborhoods,
implementing reaction-diffusion models, implementing turtle-type agents, etc.

\subsection{Higher-Level Functions}

Scheme is used at a higher (supervisory) level for path-finding, goal-satisfaction, and other agent-level scripting by designers.
S-expression dynamic storage associated with each cell.

Low-level state machine can move or destroy higher-level S-expression storage, but not copy or increase it, nor read or modify its contents.

Board:
Cubic lattice.
Square slab, $S \times S \times D$.
Assuming 64-bit architecture (128 bits/cell), requires $16S^2 D$ bytes.

\subsection{Polymer State Machines}

Polymers fundamental to modeling thermodynamically fluctuating enclosures like micelles.
Also to modeling biological polymers: RNA and proteins.

Doi-Edwards theory \cite{DoiEdwards1988}

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:polymer}.

\fbox{\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Polymer.png}}
\caption{
\label{fig:polymer}
A few cases in the explicit automata-theoretic enumeration of polymer diffusion on the square lattice.
}
\end{figure}

Observations on model scaling:
Lookup/modify, no indirect addressing (closest thing to state tables): 2.3Mb.
Only 52k gzipped (still vicious to expand).
With indirect addressing: down to 127k (gzipped: 3k).
Scheme generator is 5k (gzipped: 1k).


\subsection{RNA State Machines}

RNA on a lattice \cite{LeoniVanderzande2003,JostEveraers2010,ZaraPretti2007,GillespieMayneJiang2009}


As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:rna}.

\section{Game Design}

\subsection{Basic Play}

Terraforming simulation.
Isometric PAINT with live pixels.

Game goal: maintain dynamic equilibrium between three RPS species within a vesicle.

\subsection{Network Play}

Multiplayer implementation: RESTful server \cite{rest}.
Post lock, check board out/in.

Time-limited turns, minimum time between turns, max tool recharge per day.

Multiplayer goal: keep your population alive under attack.

Earn game-money from your population.

Client: log in/out, browse worlds, pick a world, select terraforming tools...

\subsection{Creating New Tools}

Player can POST XML to server describing new particles and tools
(with restrictions, e.g. no Scheme code at present, due partly to prohibitions on Turing-complete code transfer by App Store owners).

Spend game-money creating and using new reaction-diffusion particles and spray-tools.

Earn game-money when others buy your tools.

\subsection{Implementation}

Gnu C, libXML, GDataXML, ChibiScheme, XCode, Catalyst (Perl).

RNA state machines implemented in Java prototype.

\section{Discussion}
