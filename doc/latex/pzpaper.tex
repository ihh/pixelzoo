\section{Introduction}

Goal: 
build simulation game for mobile devices,
set in a persistent, multiplayer, computationally-dense world
using cellular automata ({\em CA}),
featuring models from
condensed-matter physics,
mathematical biology,
 and
Artificial Life ({\em A-Life})

Progress report, describing general structure of platform,
and several models from stochastic biophysics
including simulations of polymer and RNA folding kinetics.

\section{Simulation}

\subsection{Virtual Machine}

Low-level (machine code):
state machines.

Addressing: local neighborhood.
Memory structure: bitfields. Fixed amount of dynamic storage, 16 bits given over to a type field that selects from a global program.
Remaining dynamic storage 48 bits, plus effectively unlimited read-only global storage.

Instruction set that minimally generalizes the concept of the lookup table, to facilitate partial matching of neighborhoods:
load-add-store, load-switch, load-compare, random-branch.
(Load and Store allow bitfield access.)

Control flow: goto, no loops, no gosub. Program is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of finite maximum length.
Facilitates analysis and prediction of resource usage---requirements for user-uploaded programs.

In principle do not need indirect addressing: can explicitly enumerate all cases.
In practice, useful to allow some indirect addressing, to reduce program sizes.

Low-level (assembly language):
Scheme. Generates (assembles) instructions for state machine.
Large built-in library for replicating patterns over Moore or von Neumann neighborhoods,
implementing reaction-diffusion models, implementing turtle-type agents, etc.

Observations on model scaling:
Lookup/modify, no indirect addressing (closest thing to state tables): 2.3Mb.
Only 52k gzipped (still vicious to expand).
With indirect addressing: down to 127k (gzipped: 3k).
Scheme generator is 5k (gzipped: 1k).


Higher-level (path-finding, goal-satisfaction, and other agent-level scripting):
Scheme. S-expression dynamic storage associated with each cell.

Low-level state machine can move or destroy higher-level S-expression storage, but not copy or increase it.
The stringent constraints on the low-level state machine mean that it is safe to open up the space of programs to the user,
while maintaining strong performance guarantees on the worst-case simulation rate.

Board:
Cubic lattice.
Square slab, $S \times S \times D$.

\section{Game Design}

\subsection{Basic Play}

Terraforming simulation.
Isometric PAINT with live pixels.

Game goal: maintain dynamic equilibrium between three RPS species within a vesicle.

Multiplayer implementation: RESTful server \cite{rest}.
Post lock, check board out/in.

Time-limited turns, minimum time between turns, max tool recharge per day.

Multiplayer goal: keep your population alive under attack.

Earn money from your population.

\subsection{Creating New Tools}

Spend money creating and using new reaction-diffusion particles and spray-tools.

\section{Implementation}

Gnu C, libXML, GDataXML, ChibiScheme, XCode, Catalyst (Perl).
