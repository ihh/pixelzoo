Neighborhood-Oriented VM Extensions

All these require a neighborhood (simply a list of XYZ coords) defined at the particle level

INVDIR:
Load register INVDIR with inverse of DIR, and goto NEXT
...inverse of DIR is assumed to be (DIR + TOTAL_CELLS_IN_NEIGHBORHOOD/2) % TOTAL_CELLS_IN_NEIGHBORHOOD
...could be implemented more generically by simply adding a MODULUS field to ModifyRule (at cost of bloat)

VECSUM:
Load registers (X,Y,Z,DIR,INVDIR) with vector-sum of DIR1 and DIR2, and goto NEXT (or stop if not in neighborhood)

RNDNBR:
Load registers (X,Y,Z,DIR) with a random direction adjacent to zero or more neighbors (NBR1,NBR2,NBR3,NBR4...) and goto NEXT (or stop if no mutually adjacent neighbors)
