Neighborhood-Oriented VM Extensions

All these require a neighborhood (simply a list of XYZ coords) defined at the particle level

VECSUM:
Load registers (X,Y,Z,DIR,INVDIR) with vector-sum of one or more neighbors (NBR1,NBR2...) and goto NEXT (or stop if not in neighborhood)
...NB if there is just one neighbor, this can be used to get INVDIR, or (X,Y,Z)
...Any of the result registers can be omitted

RNDNBR:
Load register (DIR) with a random direction adjacent to zero or more neighbors (NBR1,NBR2,NBR3,NBR4...) and goto NEXT (or stop if no mutually adjacent neighbors)
