Fix perl/polyzoo.pl DTD validation bug(s)
Update Zoo/dtd/{game,proto}.dtd
 <!ELEMENT neighbor (loc,x?,y?)>  ... location ID ('loc') is a string in both proto.dtd and game.dtd
Add new AddressRule/AddressRuleParams (rule.{h,c}) ... location ID is a non-negative integer (add a 'StringVector neighborName' to Board; xmlboard.c will maintain dictionary of location strings->integers)
 ... AddressRuleParams allows absolute assignments (east=(+1,0)) and symbolic assignments (fwd=east)
 ... Add new <global> neighborhood declarations to top level of board XML
Add 'int neighborAddressBufferSize' count to Board (board.{h,c}), initially 0, set by addParticleToBoard to (maxLocationID + 1)
Add 'map<int,LocalOffset*> neighborAddress' buffer to Board
Modify attemptRule (board.{h,c}) to record neighbor address bindings in neighborAddress[], and use these in Lookup/Modify/Deliver rules
 ... addresses can never be changed once bound - they are constant
 ... reset neighborAddress[] to global declarations (by shallow copy) when attemptRule() is first called, and whenever a Deliver rule is applied
 ... custom destructor that takes two neighborAddress maps (where #2 was shallow-copied from #1) & deletes elements from #2 that aren't in #1
Update XML parsers (existing syntax = shorthand for new syntax) of...
 <switch>, <modify>, <deliver> in game.dtd (involves hacking C XML parsers in xmlboard.c)
  ...XML parser should disallow references to locations that were not set by an outer rule
  ...this means that newRuleFromXmlNode (etc), in xmlboard.c, needs to pass back a set of location IDs (strings) referenced by all descendant rules in that subtree, as well as the location string->int dictionary
  ...old-style locations (src,dest,pos) should be DISALLOWED, so at least one test needs to be updated (t/simple.xml) maybe by wrapping it with some compass-direction bindings (n,e,s,w)
 <bind>, <switch>, <modify>, <deliver> in proto.dtd (involves hacking Perl)
  ...all rules must output new-style locations
Add a new test (diffusion particle)
Add new GosubRule/GosubRuleParams (rule.{h,c},board.{h,c},xmlboard.{h,c}) ... allows implementation of Moore neighborhood, polymer neighborhoods, etc, as subroutines
