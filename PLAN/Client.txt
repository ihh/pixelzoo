Test & debug polymers
Port cyclobs, cement, wall, acid, plants, guests to Scheme
Refactor Catalyst to not use Level.pm/Grammar.pm

Add some real multiplayer game content (guests become player particles, a proper end-of-turn goal in worldmeta, a test board that can be stolen)

Add summary counts of player/owner particles to lock screen

Create user/worlds controller (authenticated) that lists created, owned & neighboring worlds, together with expiry times for active locks & deletion times for any of your old locks
Modify Worlds menu to show up to 3 sections (omitting empty sections): 1) worlds that you control, 2) neighbors of worlds you control, 3) worlds you created

Automatically create one new world per player, at registration time

Add (x,y) coordinates for each world, and table of inter-world links (or travel radius?)
Add Galaxy Map view to world info screen; can use this to select neighbors of worlds you control, changing world info view to those neighbors (alternative to selecting via Worlds menu)

Rewrite PZGameView-->PZGameSKView using Sprite Kit
Change lock text to be consistent with narrative (e.g. "(creating Einstein-Rosen bridge)", "Orbital exit in 1:00"...)

Add an alert with informative error message for failed lock (rather than just popping)
Add graceful failure modes (alert-then-pop-after-appear) for all NSURLConnection's
