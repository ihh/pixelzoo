Add some real multiplayer game content (guests become player particles, a test board that can be stolen)
Add summary counts of player/owner particles to lock screen
Add an optional <overwrite> block in the game header, whose <disallow> states are added to the tool-specific <disallow> states, enabling easy specification of off-limits areas for challengers

Design some new particle content: a voter-process scintillating wall + spraytool, an SIR zombie model

Port cyclobs, cement, wall, acid, plants, guests to Scheme
Refactor Catalyst to not use Level.pm/Grammar.pm

Delete Zoo/lib/Grammar.pm, Zoo/lib/Level.pm, Zoo/lib/Level/Simple.pm
Delete Zoo/dtd/proto.dtd

Add a <rule> to create text balloons
Add a syntactic-sugar <nop> rule

Modify "world/" controller (authenticated) to list created, owned & neighboring worlds, together with expiry times for active locks & deletion times for any of your old locks
Modify Worlds menu to show up to 3 sections (omitting empty sections): 1) worlds that you control, 2) neighbors of worlds you control, 3) worlds you created

Automatically create one new world per player, at registration time

Add (x,y) coordinates for each world, and table of inter-world links (or travel radius?)
Add Galaxy Map view to world info screen; can use this to select neighbors of worlds you control, changing world info view to those neighbors (alternative to selecting via Worlds menu)

Add depth to worldmeta; replace current 2D (X*Y) board with 3D slab of height 2 (X*Y*2), allowing for "ground".

Rewrite PZGameView-->PZGameSKView using Sprite Kit (keep PZGameView for debugging)
Change lock text to be consistent with narrative (e.g. "(creating Einstein-Rosen bridge)", "Orbital exit in 1:00"...)

Add an alert with informative error message for failed lock (rather than just popping)
Add graceful failure modes (alert-then-pop-after-appear) for all NSURLConnection's

Implement ultra-basic, unsafe version of "PUT store/type", with clientside specification of particle dependencies, which automatically associates the Particle with a Tool (using particle_tool table) and adds this tool to a hardwired "experimental toolbox"
Add an experimental world + worldmeta hardwired to use the experimental toolbox
Using PegJS, implement an ultra-basic reaction-diffusion grammar editor (no safety checks, just uses "UserID/" as a prefix on particle names to avoid clashes)
