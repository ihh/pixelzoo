Implement 'Create account'

Add an alert with informative error message for failed lock (rather than just popping)
Add graceful failure modes (alert-then-pop-after-appear) for all NSURLConnection's

Add a lock timeout countdown to status, lock & game screens
Lock timeout from game screen => exit game screen, disable Play button
Exit game screen => POST turn (even if incomplete)
Exit lock screen => DELETE lock (delegate:nil?)

Add some real multiplayer game logic (player particles/tools, a test board that can be stolen)

Modify world/list controller & Worlds menu to show up to 3 sections (omitting empty sections): 1) worlds that you control, 2) neighbors of worlds you control, 3) worlds you created
Automatically create one new world per player, at registration time

Add (x,y) coordinates for each world, and table of inter-world links (or travel radius?)
Add Galaxy Map view to world info screen; can use this to select neighbors of worlds you control, changing world info view to those neighbors (alternative to selecting via Worlds menu)
