Capture the flag

This game design requires a special 'user' particle, whose 'type' field is some constant (X), and whose 'vars' field specifies a player ID.
It also requires a 'critter' particle, whose 'type' field is some constant (Y).
Finally there are some numeric constants (NX, NY).

Define an "owner-particle" to be a user particle whose 'vars' field is the ID of the current board owner.
Define a "guest-particle" to be a user particle whose 'vars' field is the ID of the current player (who is NOT the board owner).

At the end of the board owner's turn, if all of the following conditions are true, board ownership is retained:
 (a) there are at least NX owner-particles on the board;
 (b) there are at least NY critter-particles on the board.
If either (or both) of these conditions is not met, the board becomes 'unclaimed' (no-one owns it).

At the end of a guest player's turn, if all of the following conditions are true, board ownership passes to the guest:
 (a) there are at least NX guest-particles on the board;
 (b) there are fewer than NX owner-particles on the board;
 (c) there are at least NY critter-particles on the board.
If any (or all) of these conditions are not met, but both the following conditions are met, board ownership is retained by the current owner:
 (a) there are at least NX owner-particles on the board;
 (b) there are at least NY critter-particles on the board.
If either (or both) of these conditions is not met, the board becomes 'unclaimed' (no-one owns it).

Constraints:
 Turns have fixed time limits.
 After their turn, a player is locked out for a random time.
 Guest-writable-cells  \subset  Owner-writable-cells  \subseteq  Board



Possible future extensions:
Users can upload their own particle and tool XML.
New particles/tools are priced by the system.
Tool designers get in-game credit when players buy their tools.
