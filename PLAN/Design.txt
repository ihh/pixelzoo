Molecular evolution level

RPS = RockPaperScissors

CELLS
Polymers
- Free radical monomer units spontaneously fuse together into polymers
Water
- these diffuse fast
- other particles can't move through vacuum, can only switch places with water molecules
Ownership goal: create some quantum dots (these just go around in circles), keep them alive.
Goal #1: create a temporary enclosure, seed it with monomers, allow some bubbles to form.
Goal #2: create a bubble with a self-sustaining RPS reaction inside.
- R's make bubbles contract, G's make them expand, B's make them porous
Hierarchical arrangement of organelles - each level emits some vital ingredient to its enclosing cell
- e.g. when RGB pass through cell walls, they become Magenta/Yellow/Cyan
Goal #3: sustain a CYM reaction inside a cell.

Challenger goal: destroy quantum dots.
Viruses attack cells. Subvert a cell, turn it over to production of the virus.
- Virus consumes RGB; at some low rate, virus lyses cell
- Virus consumes quantum dots
Generic & specific antivirals.
Directionally flowing acid (limited ration per day)
- Buffer solution neutralizes acid
Decaying walls
Harder walls built by diffusion-limited aggregation of cell-emitted lava particles
(limited ration of lava per day)
Guns, bombs (limited ration per day)
- Potassium particles that react with water



FOREST
Grow a complex balanced ecosystem of plants & animals (Quince et al)
Rare creatures that must be kept safe from predators.


CITY
House builders.
Roads. Road builders.
Diseases. Zombie infections.
