<!-- PixelZoo Goal is a domain-specific mini-language for testing challenge conditions

A Goal expression is a function, with side effects, that returns a Boolean (true or false) value.

Each Goal expression operates on a given <i>area</i> of the Board
 (i.e. a subset of the Board's cells). By default, this area is inherited
 from the parent Goal expression, and the default area for the root Goal is the entire Board.

<!-- A particle update rule. There are six types (of which only four are public),
 plus four constructs that are provided by the compiler for convenience,
 constituting an extremely minimal and predictable programming language for cellular automata.

The four compiler constructs are <b>bind</b>, <b>nop</b>, <b>huff</b>, and <b>ball</b>:
<ul><li>
 <b>bind</b> temporarily associates a name in the compiler's namespace
 with a neighboring cell location and performs a <b>switch</b> rule on the particle type at that location.
</li><li>
 <b>nop</b> does nothing (implemented by the compiler using a dummy <b>modify</b> rule).
</li><li>
 <b>huff</b> allows for a probability distribution over an arbitrary number of rules
(implemented by the compiler using <b>random</b> rules and a Huffmann tree).
</li><li>
 <b>ball</b> is a shortcut for a <b>goal</b> rule that places a text balloon.
</li></ul>

The four public rules are <b>switch</b>, <b>modify</b>, <b>random</b>, and <b>deliver</b>:
<ul><li>
 <b>switch</b>
  (read a Var from any named local cell,
   look up corresponding rule in a table,
   execute that rule).
</li><li>
 <b>modify</b>, effectively a <i>load-add-store</i> instruction
  (read a Var from any local cell,
   add or subtract a certain amount,
   store value in Var of any local cell).
</li><li>
 <b>random</b>, introducing stochasticity
  (executes one of two child rules by flipping a biased coin).
</li><li>
 <b>deliver</b>, which sends a 64-bit <i>message</i> to a local cell
  (passing control to an update rule in that particle's dispatch table).
</li></ul>

The two private (internally-used) rules are <b>goto</b> and <b>goal</b>:
<ul><li>
 <b>goto</b>, used not to loop, but simply to save space,
  (passes control to a named subroutine, which never returns),
</li><li>
 <b>goal</b>, allowing a callback hook for in-game feedback and effects
  (tests a Goal, if the Board has an associated Game).
</li></ul>
